# Deployment Instructions for Vue Hydromind Project

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and sign in or create an account.
2. Click on "New" to create a new repository.
3. Name the repository (e.g., `vue-hydromind`).
4. Choose Public or Private.
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you can add later).
6. Click "Create repository".

## Step 2: Push Your Project to GitHub
1. Open a terminal in your project directory (`c:/Users/muham/Downloads/Vue-hydromind`).
2. Initialize git if not already:
   ```
   git init
   ```
3. Add all files:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
4. Commit the files:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
5. Add the remote repository URL (replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>`):
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
6. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Deploy Using GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Click on "Settings" > "Pages".
3. Under "Source", select the branch `main` and folder `/root` or `/docs` if you want.
4. Save.
5. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (mrmhr.space)
1. You need to have control over the DNS settings of `mrmhr.space`.
2. In your domain registrar's DNS management, create a CNAME record:
   - Name: `www` (or `@` for root domain)
   - Value: `<your-username>.github.io`
3. In your GitHub repository, under "Settings" > "Pages", enter `mrmhr.space` as the custom domain.
4. GitHub will provision HTTPS automatically.
5. It may take some time for DNS changes to propagate.

## Alternative Hosting
If you do not have control over DNS or want a simpler approach, you can use services like Netlify or Vercel to deploy your site and get a free subdomain.
